# date_scraper
This is a simple instagram scraper, which takes in a list of instagram posts, finds the dates for each one (from the html code), counts how many posts were created on each day, then creates a .csv with the date in one column and the number of posts for that date in the other. 
I created this because I didn't want to figure out how to use the Instagram API/Sandbox/whatever they're referring to nowadays.
